# Spotify-Clone
Hi! I’m learning web development, and this is one of my practice projects — a simple Spotify clone using only HTML and CSS. It’s not fully functional, but I tried to make it look like the real Spotify homepage.


# 🎵 Spotify Clone (Beginner Project)

Hi! I’m learning web development, and this is a simple **Spotify Clone** I made using just **HTML and CSS**. It’s a static project with no real functionality — I built it to practice layout, design, and improve my frontend skills.

## 🛠️ Tools Used

- **HTML5** – Structure of the page
- **CSS3** – Styling and layout (used Flexbox)

## 📌 Features

- Sidebar with Home, Search, and Library
- Playlist section with song cards (dummy)
- Top navigation bar
- Music player footer design (not functional)

## 🎯 What I Learned

- Creating a web page layout like real apps
- Using Flexbox for positioning
- Styling UI elements like buttons and cards
- Organizing code properly

## 📱 Responsive?

 I’m still learning, so it works okay on desktop. I’ll improve responsiveness later.
